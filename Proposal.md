# Lab 2 Project Proposal

## Our Team
  - Mary "If I tell you, I'll have to kill you" Keenan, the Artist
  - Sam "I'm over it" Myers, the Secretary
  - Cecelia "Mookie" Auerswald, the Bossman
 
## Our APIs
  - Indico Facial Emotion Recognition
  - Camera (Chimera? Samera?)
  - mebbe others idk

## MVP

We want to be able to take a picture of a person, send it to the API, and return a MoodCookie to the user, i.e. something that says something about what the mood in the picture was. We'd have a small set of preset MoodCookies.

## Stretch Goals (in the order we will implement them)
 - Make the MoodCookie nicer and probably inclued an edited image with text overlayed.
 - The ability to download/save the MoodCookie.
 - To not use hard coded text for the MoodCookies and instead generate them on the fly or scrape them from the internet.
 - To let people choose whose flavor of MoodCookie they want, Cecelia, Sam, or Mary.

## Division of Labor

Equal. ;)



Jk.
We will try to work in the same space but on different parts of the app at a time. (The space will be David and Bill's room because we will have access to teaching team help and ample floor space for independent work and yoga.) 

## Where We Plan to be by 10/20
